##### Definition for standardization of commits.

* 1 - Make individual commits.

Commit only one change at a time. Do not practice "correcting this and implementing it". If there are multiple changes to your sources, separate them into individual commits.

* 2 - Specify what you did in your commit.

Find a commit message that is clear and objective. This may fail sometimes but you need to search.

* 3 - Use the commit prefixes.

To make commits, please use the prefixes provided below.

| Commit Type        | Prefix        | Example                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |

| Implementation     | Added         | Added: Connect button.                    |
| Documentation      | Doc           | Doc: Connection Class.                    |
| TODO Resolve       | From TODO     | From TODO: Treatment for null connection. |

# Contributing to DB Browser

## Submission Guidelines

### Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/xdanif/db-browser/issues), maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario.
